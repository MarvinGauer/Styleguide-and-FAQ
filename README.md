\- Please format your added content according to YAML as described in the [Styleguide](https://github.com/QuantLet/Validation-procedure-and-Styleguide/blob/master/Styleguide.md). Thanks to your effort, we are able to automatically provide a standardized Readme.md to your repository.

__Guideline I:__
- Abbreviations
  - Q = Quantlet
  - QNet = Quantnet
  - repo = repository
  - GH = GitHub
  
__Guideline II:__
- Every Q has to be in its own subfolder in the repository. 
  - Reponame/Qfolder1/files of Q1
  - Reponame/Qfolder2/files of Q2
  - Reponame/Qfolder3/files of Q3
  
- Some Examples:

  1. [MSM] (https://github.com/QuantLet/MSM)
  2. [Psychological-diagnostics] (https://github.com/QuantLet/Psychological-diagnostics)
  3. [TimeVaryingPenalization] (https://github.com/QuantLet/TimeVaryingPenalization)

__Guideline III:__
- Avoid blanks in the repository names!
- Avoid unnecessary special characters in the names of repositories, subfolders and Qs
- In case of doubt use the underscore character "_"
- Some good Examples:
  1. [big_data_analysis] (https://github.com/QuantLet/big_data_analysis)
  2. [MMSTAT] (https://github.com/QuantLet/MMSTAT)
  3. [Git2Q3-Collaboration] (https://github.com/QuantLet/Git2Q3-Collaboration)
- Some bad Examples:
  1. [lCARE-BTU-HU-] (https://github.com/QuantLet/lCARE-BTU-HU-)
- Please note that repos with bad name notation will be excluded from final validation and importing into the [Visualization] (http://quantnet.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/d3/ia/). It's up to you to rename your repos accordingly. Actually, some special characters make the automatic processing impossible.
